1. Write a Shell program to find the sum of odd and even numbers from a set of numbers.
#!/bin/bash

sum_odd=0
sum_even=0

# Prompt the user to enter numbers
echo "Enter a set of numbers (separated by spaces):"
read -a numbers

# Loop through the numbers
for num in "${numbers[@]}"; do
    if (( num % 2 == 0 )); then
        # If the number is even, add it to the even sum
        sum_even=$((sum_even + num))
    else
        # If the number is odd, add it to the odd sum
        sum_odd=$((sum_odd + num))
    fi
done

# Display the results
echo "Sum of even numbers: $sum_even"
echo "Sum of odd numbers: $sum_odd"

2. Write a Shell program to find the smallest number from a set of numbers.
#!/bin/bash

echo "ENter a set of numbers (separated by spaces):"
read -a numbers

small=numbers[0]

for i in "${numbers[@]}";
do
	if(( i < small )); then
		small=$i
	fi
done

echo "Smallest number: $small"

3. Write a Shell program to find the sum of all numbers between 50 and 100, which are divisible by 3 and
not divisible by 5.
sum=0
for (( c = 50; c <= 100; c++ ));
do
        if(( c % 3 == 0 && c % 5 != 0)); then
                sum=$((sum+c))
        fi
done
echo "Sum: $sum"

4. Calculator:
#! /bin/bash
echo "Select an operation:"
echo
echo "1. Addition (+)"
echo "2. Subtraction (-)"
echo "3. Multiplication (*)"
echo "4. Division (/)"
echo "5. Exit"
echo
echo "Enter Operator (1-5):"
read op
if [ $op = 5 ]; then
        exit
fi
echo "Enter the first number:"
read a
echo "Enter the second number:"
read b
echo "Result:"
if [ $op = 1 ]; then
        echo $a + $b = $((a+b))
elif [ $op = 2 ]; then
        echo $a - $b = $((a-b))
elif [ $op = 3 ]; then
        echo $a * $b = $((a*b))
elif [ $op = 4 ]; then
        if [ $b = 0 ]; then
                echo "Division by 0 is undefined."
        else
                echo $a / $b = $((a/b))
        fi
else
        echo "Invalid operator."
fi
